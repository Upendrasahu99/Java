/**    In Java, a functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces are used to enable the use of lambda expressions, which are a concise way of representing anonymous functions.
*
*        Here are some common types of functional interfaces:
*
*        1). Predicate: A predicate is a functional interface that takes a single argument and returns a boolean. It is often used for filtering and testing values.
*
*        2). Function: A function is a functional interface that takes a single argument and returns a value of a specified type. It is often used for mapping values.
*
*        3). Consumer: A consumer is a functional interface that takes a single argument and returns no value. It is often used for performing side effects.
*
*        4). Supplier: A supplier is a functional interface that takes no arguments and returns a value. It is often used for lazy evaluation.
*
*        5). UnaryOperator: A unary operator is a functional interface that takes a single argument of a specified type and returns a value of the same type. It is often used for transforming values.
*
*        6). BinaryOperator: A binary operator is a functional interface that takes two arguments of a specified type and returns a value of the same type. It is often used for combining values.
*
*        7). BiFunction: A BiFunction is a functional interface that takes two arguments of different types and returns a value of a specified type. It is often used for mapping between two types.
*
*        These are just a few examples of the many functional interfaces available in Java. Functional interfaces are an important feature of the Java language and are used extensively in functional programming paradigms.
